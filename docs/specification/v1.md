# Purpose

Inject learner‑specific vocabulary, idioms, and other language concepts into
long‑form web texts, thereby “flooding” the learner’s reading environment 
with high‑value material chosen by the app’s adaptive scheduler.


# Background

Glite Tech has developed an advanced English learning app designed 
for non-beginners (Level B1+). The app focuses on identifying and rectifying 
gaps in learners' knowledge by breaking the English language down into 
granular "concepts." These concepts include vocabulary items (individual word 
meanings, phrasal verbs, idioms, multi-word expressions), pronunciation 
nuances, spelling rules, grammatical structures, conversational 
norms, and standard phrases.

The core app utilizes a sophisticated adaptive learning algorithm, 
similar to spaced repetition but more advanced, to determine which concepts 
a user should focus on based on their learning history. Currently, the app 
allows users to actively study these concepts, particularly vocabulary.

To enhance the learning process and provide contextual reinforcement, 
we aim to develop a browser extension. This extension will subtly modify 
the text content users encounter while browse the web, "flooding" their 
reading experience with the specific concepts (words, idioms, phrasal verbs,
etc.) that our backend identifies as beneficial for their current learning 
stage. This creates an immersive, passive learning environment that 
complements the active study within the main application.


# User Stories

1. As a learner I install the extension, sign in once, and every article 
I read is seamlessly sprinkled with words/phrases I need to practice, 
without layout breakage or noticeable lag.

2. As an accessibility‑conscious user I can toggle augmentation per site, 
pause it for a page, or switch to “highlight‑only” instead of replacement.


# Important Principles

* Don't do harm - if there are any doubtes (performance, web page functionality,
etc) it is better to do nothing than create problems for a user.

* Smooth user experience - the browser extension should not slow down browsing
experience. Minimum operations in the main thread. 

* Modular architecture with abstract functions for main operations, so they can 
easily be extended/replaced later:
  - LLM call
  - highlighting changed text
  - finding "long-enough" texts
  - creating concept candidates for the sentence
  - mark element as already change / check if this element was already changed
  - detecting if a certain concept was "seen" by a user

* Don't breaks event listeners

* Minimum changes in the DOM. Target only the text content. Avoid altering 
surrounding DOM structure, attributes, or event listeners as much as possible.

* Dont' reinvent a bicycle, if there are well supported rebust third-party 
libraries for some pieces for functionality we need - use them.


# Features

* Modifying only long texts - only target text nodes ≥ N words long, skip navbars, 
sidebars, footers, etc.

* Limit the number of highlights in one paragraph and per 1000 words (configurable
parameters).

* User configurable setting for agressivness of augmentation. LLM API returns
score from 0 to 5 how much this replacement changes the meaning and tone of the 
text. The browser extension ignores all changes with scrore below this parameter.

* Taking visible website area in consideration to avoid overusing LLM API for text
that won't be read. For very long text the extension should replace texts only
in the initially visible area plus some buffer and trigger additional replacing 
as the webpage is scrolled.

* Handling dynamic content - support web pages that create/add content dynamically. 

* Caching the list of learned concepts during the day as it doesn't change much during
a day.

* Reporting analitics about replaced concepts that were seen by the user. The browser
extension should use clearly defined logic to understand if the user saw this concept
based on visibility of this concept on the screen and time spent (if the page was
scrolled too fast we don't consider those concepts as "seen").

* Global and user defined black lists of websites not to modify 


# Backend API

There are four groups of backend APIs fin this project:
1. Authentication
2. Getting user learning concepts
3. LLM call to augment text
4. Analitics reporting
5. Settings

## 2. Getting user learning concepts
